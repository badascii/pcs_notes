Week 7 Notes - Rails and Databases
==================================

  Git
  ---

    -fetch brings us up to date with the master but does not move HEAD
    -when merge/rebase is used it then actually updates the local files
     (current working directory)

    Branches
      -origin = GitHub
      -master = a specific branch, either local or remote
      -it is a good idea to always make a new branch when working on an
       established project
      -origin is just a random branch name that is widely adopted due to GitHub
       using it as the default branch when cloning
      -"github" could easily replace "origin" as the default branch and may
       in the near future

      merge multiple branches:

        -git checkout master
        -git merge all

        -a branch is simply a pointer
        -it it points to a different point in the code's history
