Week 7 Notes - Rails and Databases
==================================

  Git
  ---

    -fetch brings us up to date with the master but does not move HEAD
    -when merge/rebase is used it then actually updates the local files
     (current working directory)

    Branches
      -origin = GitHub
      -master = a specific branch, either local or remote
      -it is a good idea to always make a new branch when working on an
       established project
      -origin is just a random branch name that is widely adopted due to GitHub
       using it as the default branch when cloning
      -"github" could easily replace "origin" as the default branch and may
       in the near future
