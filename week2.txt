Week 2 Notes - Ruby Testing

  Consistent Naming

    -There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
     naming things. -Phil Karlton

  Debuggers

    debugger:
    1) require 'debugger'
    2) add the word debugger to a problem area of the code
    3) the logic will freeze at that point
    4) the code can then be stepped through in rdb
    5) commands: step, next, continue

    vlad:
    -debugs a frozen program

    pry:
    -fully functional irb
    -cannot be stepped through

  -puts vs. p
  puts generally applies to_s
  p prints the result of inspecting the object

  Testing

    KPI: Key Performance Indicators
      -most important sections of code where tests should be focused
      -critical parts should be tested no matter whtat

  What to Test

    -every significant input and output
    -any complicated bits
    -things coworkers can break
    -things coworkers won't test manually
    -anything unreliable (ie. APIs and anything network based)
