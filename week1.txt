Week 1 Notes - Ruby

  Smell test for methods
    -When only declaring and calling a method


  Functional languages use immutable variables.


  Order of operations
  -"&&" and "||" have higher precedence than "and" and "or"
    -"and" and "or" evaluate after "="

  -"not" is evaluated right before "and" and "or"


  Classes
    -Factory that makes objects
      -better description than "blueprint"

    -Self refers to the current class or method (the scope)
      -When outside of either (ie irb), it refers to the program being run (which is the current scope)


  Return
    -Exits the entire method when called inside a loop
    -It exits the current scope


  Integers
    -.downto instance method


  Recursion
    -Analogy:
      -If you are home, stop moving
      -Else take one small step toward home
      -Once home, speak the path

    -Tail recursion
      -can replace loops
      -head is isolated (0 index) from tail (rest of array)
      -head is then compared to the new head (new 0 index)

    -Break the problem down to simplest possible form

    -Aggregate results
